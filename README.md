# gotSurvey

gotSurvey is an example ASP.NET application used to track the results of a fake survey for GOT. Since GOT was ending at season eight I decided to create this.

# Usage
After opening using IIS Express in Visual Studio:
```
Browse to:
    http://localhost:#####/Index.aspx
    http://localhost:#####/ViewSubmissions.aspx
```
## View Submissions
The View Submissions page is used to view the results of all of the submissions

# Execution
You can start the application using Visual Studio in IIS Express Server (what I used).
